Teensy-RET
=======

Reverse Engineering Tool, forked from Collin80, modified to work on Teensy 3.2 with no SD card.

Only the transceivers are relevant to this 
project but the project is setup to use pin 2 for enabling CAN0 and pin 35 for CAN1 enable. Set this as appropriate for your
designs or to 255 to disable if no enable pin is needed.

The project builds with the Arduino IDE with the TeensyDuino add-on.

WARNING: This is currently an early port of GVRET. Some things won't work, some things will crash. But, initial testing shows
compatibility with SavvyCAN, ability to read frames to the console, and stability at high bus loads.

#### Requirements:

1.6.x Arduino IDE

TeensyDuino 1.31 or newer

FlexCAN library from me (https://github.com/collin80/FlexCAN_Library)

SDCard-Beta library  (https://github.com/greiman/SdFat-beta)

The canbus is supposed to be terminated on both ends of the bus. This should not be a problem as this firmware will be used to reverse engineer existing buses.
